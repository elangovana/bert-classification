Programmed cell death (PCD) is a genetically-controlled disassembly of the cell. In animal systems                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,the central core execution switch for apoptotic PCD is the activation of caspases (Cysteine-containing Aspartate-specific proteases). Accumulating evidence in recent years suggests the existence of caspase-like activity in plants and its functional involvement in various types of plant PCD                                                                      ,although no functional homologs of animal caspases were identified in plant genome. In this mini-review,we will cover the recent results on the existence of plant caspase-like proteases and introduce major technologies used in detecting the activation of caspase-like proteases during plant PCD.	1	19938376\r
Plants develop various ER-derived structures with specific functions. The ER body found in Arabidopsis thaliana is a spindle-shaped structure. ER bodies accumulate in epidermal cells in seedlings or are induced by wounding. The molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the ER body remained obscure. We isolated an ER body-deficient mutant in Arabidopsis seedlings            ,which we termed nai2. The NAI2 gene encodes a member of a unique protein family. NAI2 localizes to the ER body and the downregulation of NAI2 elongates ER bodies and reduces their number. ER bodies specifically accumulate high levels of PYK10/BGLU23                                                                                                               ,which is a beta-glucosidase that bears an ER retention signal. Additionally                            ,in the nai2 mutant                                                                                                                                                                                          ,PYK10 protein is diffuse throughout the ER and the PYK10 protein level is reduced. These observations indicate that NAI2 is a key factor for the formation of ER bodies and for the accumulation of PYK10 in the ER bodies of Arabidopsis. We also found that BGLU18,which encodes another beta-glucosidase with an ER retention signal                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,is induced at the site of wounding. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the BGLU18 protein is exclusively localized in ER bodies formed directly at the wounding site of cotyledons. These results suggest that BGLU18 is a component of the ER body in wounded leaves of Arabidopsis.	1	19847124
Climbing plants have fascinated botanists since the pioneering works of Darwin and his contemporaries in the 19(th) century. Diverse plants have evolved different ways of climbing and a wide range of attachment devices and stem biomechanics to cope with the particular physical demands of life as a climber. We investigated the biomechanics of attachment in a range of climbing palms,including true rattans from Southeast Asia and the genus Desmoncus from South America. We found that hook strength and orientation is coordinated with rachis geometry and rigidity. These findings support the notion of a ratchet-type attachment mechanism and partly explain why these spiny plants are so catchy and efficient at attaching to supports.	0	19847117

In the present study                                                                                                                                         ,we took advantage of this model to analyze the implication of intracellular Ca(2+) stores in ABA signal transduction through electrophysiological current measurements                                                                                              ,cytosolic Ca(2+) activity measurements with the apoaequorin Ca(2+) reporter protein and external pH measurement. Intracellular Ca(2+) stores involvement was determined by using specific inhibitors of CICR channels: the cADP-ribose/ryanodine receptor (Br-cADPR and dantrolene) and of the inositol trisphosphate receptor (U73122). In addition experiments were performed on epidermal strips of A. thaliana leaves to monitor stomatal closure in response to ABA in presence of the same pharmacology. Our data provide evidence that ryanodine receptor and inositol trisphosphate receptor could be involved in ABA-induced (1) Ca(2+) release in the cytosol,(2) anion channel activation and H(+)-ATPase inhibition leading to plasma membrane depolarization and (3) stomatal closure. Intracellular Ca(2+) release could thus contribute to the control of early events in the ABA signal transduction pathway in A. thaliana.	1	19847112
